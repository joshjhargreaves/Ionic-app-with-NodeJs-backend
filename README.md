fullstack
=========

N.B This project is very much a progress and I haven't decided where it is going.
I couldn't find any projects with backends for Ionic apps so I decided to make an app with one.

Things are still pretty messy I.E. files are still included which shouldn't be,
and it's pretty embaressing releasing it now, but I thought there's no harm in putting it out there!

[Ionic] (https://github.com/driftyco/ionic) app with NodeJs Express based on a
backend generated by [Angular fullstack generator] (https://github.com/DaftMonk/fullstack-demo)

This project uses MongoDB, so having a database listening on Localhost should be fine.

The backend hasn't changed much from one genertated by the fullstack generator, so please
do see that project for setting environment variables (such as Facebook client IDs), the MongoDB url etc.

## Live Demo
[demo] (http://fullstack.joshhargreav.es)

## Quick Start

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hardgreaves/fullstack
$ cd fullstack
$ npm install & bower install
$ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser
$ gulp build
$ node server/app.js
```
To build/run the project as a native app run from within the client
folder. Note that when built as a native app you should chance *apiUrl*
in the config service to the url of your api server.

```bash
  ionic run [Platform]
```

## Notes
This project uses [gulp] (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/) along with bower
to inject dependencies into www/index.html using the command 'gulp build'.
Run gulp sass from within the client folder to generate CSS from the ionic.app.scss
file in SCSS. (This will be fixed shortly...)

##Social Login
As per the *Angular fullstack* backend, login via Facebook, google and twitter
is implemented backend wise. It should just be a case of setting the environment
variables for *client urls* and using the *oauth* function in the login controller.

Currently I've used the cordova [in app browser] (https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/) plugin
to open a page at http://yourserver.com/auth/facebook (for example). This then redirects to the login page for that
provideer, which in turn redirects to /auth/provider/callback which then redirects to the default page with a token as a paramter. The app checks the URL when a 'loadstart' event is fired on the created window, and parses the URL for this token.
One this token is obtained, it can be added to the cookies, and request for the user object can be made.

## Contact etc
Please feel to make pull requests, fork the project and direct mesesage me.
